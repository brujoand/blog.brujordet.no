I'm a Norwegian Software Engineer, weight lifter, hobby psychologist, metal head
and I love to automate things. For the last few years I've been helping Tech
companies implement DevOps best practices. At home I'm a husband, a dad and I
build things for fun and not so much profit. I love working with Bash, so there
will probably be a lot of that.

For this blog I'll be keeping things short and to the point. There will be no
ads, because who has time for that anyway.
